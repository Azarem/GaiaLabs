## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Database-Driven Multi-Game Support

The platform uses a **database-driven architecture** where each supported game requires a comprehensive JSON database definition that describes:

- **ROM Structure**: Memory layout, compression algorithms, file formats
- **Asset Definitions**: Graphics, sound, music, assembly code locations
- **Editing Capabilities**: Which editors are applicable for each asset type
- **Game-Specific Logic**: Custom processing rules and transformations

**Prerequisite for New Game Support**: A complete database definition must exist before development can begin for any new game. The database serves as the "blueprint" that tells the engine how to:
- Extract and process ROM data
- Present editing interfaces
- Rebuild modified ROMs
- Validate asset integrity

**Launch Games**:
- **Illusion of Gaia** (US/JP/DM variants) - Complete database available
- **Future Games** - Requires community contribution of database definitions

### Database Requirements for New Game Support

To add support for a new game, the following database components must be created:

#### Core Database Files
- **`config.json`**: Game metadata, entry points, and processing configuration
- **`blocks.json`**: Memory block definitions with extraction rules
- **`files.json`**: File location mappings within ROM structure
- **`mnemonics.json`**: Processor instruction definitions (if different from standard)
- **`structs.json`**: Game-specific data structure definitions

#### Optional Enhancement Files
- **`overrides.json`**: Special case handling during extraction/building
- **`transforms.json`**: Post-processing transformations
- **`rewrites.json`**: Address remapping for relocated code
- **`stringCommands.json`**: Text processing command definitions
- **`copdef.json`**: Coprocessor definitions for special instructions

#### Database Validation Schema
All database files must conform to the established JSON schema to ensure:
- **Structural Integrity**: Correct format and required fields
- **Data Consistency**: Valid references between related components
- **Compatibility**: Adherence to platform processing requirements
- **Performance**: Optimized data structures for efficient processing
