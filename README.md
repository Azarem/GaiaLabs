# GaiaLabs
Illusion of Gaia disassembler with COProcessor call awareness and data struct support. Adding more features regularly.
The goal is to re-assemble all the pieces and create new rom files. This will allow you to potentially change any part of the game.

## Potential Uses
- Expand rom to 4mb and remove file compression (improves load times)
- Write new code modules and apply them to the rom
- Add completely new areas to the game
